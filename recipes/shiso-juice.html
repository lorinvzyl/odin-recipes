                <h2>Description</h2> <!-- A few paragraphs describing the dish/recipe -->
                <p>Shiso juice is peppery, sweet and slightly acidic but also incredibly refreshing. It will be your go to this summer! I highly recommend making this in big batches at a time</p> <!-- Chef PK description https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCNyvyVdwMM -->

                <h2>Ingredients</h2> <!-- Ingredients needed for the recipe in an unordered list -->
            	<ul>
                        <li>500 g Red/Purple Shiso leaves</li>
                        <li>500 ml water</li>
                        <li>100 g sugar</li>
                        <li>60 ml apple cider vinegar</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2> <!-- Steps needed for making the dish -->
                <ol>
                        <li>Prepare shiso leaves to boil. Wash and trim the shiso leaves.</li>
                        <li>Bring the 500 ml water to boil in a large sauce pan and add the prepared shiso leaves.</li>
                        <li>Turn the heat down to medium heat and cook the shiso leaves for about a few minutes. The leaves colour will change from purple to a greenish colour.</li>
                        <li>Drain the shiso leaves with a strainer and squeeze the leaves to extract as much as you can. It is hot so be careful not to burn your fingers. I used a spoon to extract all liquid.</li>
                        <li>Place the drained liquid back into the saucepan through a fine-mesh sieve and bring it simmer.</li>
                        <li>Add the sugar, and when the sugar is dissolved, turn the heat off and add the apple cider vinegar.</li>
                        <li>Cool it down and keep it in a clean bottle in a fridge.  If you sterilize the container in which you keep the syrup, it will last about 6 months in the fridge.</li>
                        <li>To make shiso juice, place 60 ml of the syrup into a glass and pour about 200 ml of mineral water or fizzy soda water over the top. Add ice cubes.</li>
                </ol>
