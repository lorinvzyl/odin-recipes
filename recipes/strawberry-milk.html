                <h2>Description</h2> <!-- A few paragraphs describing the dish/recipe -->
                <p>Nothing will make you more powerful than some Strawberry Milk.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2> <!-- Ingredients needed for the recipe in an unordered list -->
                <ul>
			<li>1 kg strawberries</li>
			<li>100 g granulated sugar</li>
			<li>Milk</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2> <!-- Steps needed for making the dish -->
                <ol>
			<li>Cut strawberries into small bite-sized pieces.</li>
			<li>Place strawberries into a bowl and add the sugar. Mix well and scrape sugars off the sides once done mixing.</li>
			<li>Let the strawberries sit for 15 minutes at room temperature. There should be liquids at the bottom of the bowl once done.</li>
			<li>Place the strawberries and juices into a pot and cook over a medium heat. Make sure it is not too high, as you do not want to scorch or cook the strawberries too much at this stage.</li>
			<li>Cook for 15 minutes, or until a lot of the juices of the strawberry is released.</li>
			<li>Bring to a simmer and cook for 15-20 minutes. Let the strawberries cool down in a container of your choice.</li>
			<li>Place a small amount of your jam into your drinking vessel, and add a small amount of milk. Use a hand blender to blend the jam and the milk together. Once smooth, add the rest of your milk.</li>
